Open scientific data are of paramount importance to the scientific community and contribute daily to the acceleration of scientific advance. Outlined here are changes to and updates on the ENA service in 2024, aligning with the broad goals of enhancing interoperability, globalisation of the service and scaling the platform to meet current and future needs.},
